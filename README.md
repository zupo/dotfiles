# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

It targets macOS systems, but it should work on \*nix as well.


## Install

1. Use the official Nix installer for macOS: https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-macos

2. Follow `Install` steps for nix-darwin: https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin

3. Get my dotfiles and link them to places where they are used:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zupo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/.hushlogin ~/
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/.gitignore ~/
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/.gitattributes ~/
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/.direnvrc ~/.direnvrc
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/darwin-configuration.nix ~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix
$ mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User.bak
$ ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/vscode ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User
```

4. `nix-channel`s are implicit and bad, so I remove them and instead pin nixpkgs to commit hashes in [`pins/*.nix`](https://github.com/zupo/dotfiles/tree/master/pins):

```
$ rm ~/.nix-channels
$ rm ~/.nix-defexpr/channels
```

5. What to do with `/etc/zshrc` and `/etc/zprofile`?


TL;DR:
```
$ sudo ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/zprofile.local /etc/zprofile.local
$ sudo ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/zshrc.local /etc/zshrc.local
$ sudo rm /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal
```

## Details

MacOS comes with the following:

* `/etc/zprofile`
* `/etc/zshrc`
* `/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal`

I keep them in this repo, to track changes over time as new versions of macOS are released.

### `/etc/zprofile`

Saved in this repo as `zprofile.local` and symlinked into `/etc` where
nix-darwin generated `/etc/static/zprofile` loads it.

### `/etc/zshrc`

Saved in this repo as `zshrc.local` and symlinked into `/etc` where
nix-darwin generated `/etc/static/zshrc` loads it.

My personal ZSH configuration is in `~/.zshrc`.

### `/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal`

I don't use it because it only provides two features I don't need:
* emacs support,
* automatic history save/restore -> I prefer to use a shared history.

### Final result

In the end, the `/etc` folder should be like this:

```
/etc âžœ ls -l z
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  20 Sep 14 18:17 zprofile -> /etc/static/zprofile
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  36 Sep 20 13:42 zprofile.local -> /Users/zupo/.dotfiles/zprofile.local
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  18 Apr  7  2020 zshenv -> /etc/static/zshenv
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  17 Sep 20 11:30 zshrc -> /etc/static/zshrc
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  33 Sep 20 13:27 zshrc.local -> /Users/zupo/.dotfiles/zshrc.local
```
