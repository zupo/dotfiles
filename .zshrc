# Better shell history
# (Inspired by https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh-part-3-shell-options/)

# By default, when you exit zsh this particular instance of zsh
# will overwrite an existing history file with its history. So
# when you have multiple tabs open, they will all overwrite
# each othersâ€™ histories eventually. Tell zsh to use a single,
# shared history file across the sessions and append to it
# rather than overwrite:
setopt SHARE_HISTORY
setopt APPEND_HISTORY

# Tell zsh to update the history file after every command,
# rather than waiting for the shell to exit:
setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY
