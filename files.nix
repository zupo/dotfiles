## resetting staged

`!git reset HEAD .`

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a series (stack) of logical git commits, make sure that each commit is holistic, don't commit a new library separately from the code that uses it. Aim for no more than 3 commits unless is definitely makes sense to go beyond it.

## Formatting

* Use `*` instead of `â€¢` for bullet points.
* Ask me what issue this commit is related to, and append the link to it at the end of the commit message, like so: `Refs <>`
* Never, under any circumstance, append `Generated with Claude Code`.

## Reminders

- write a good commit message with excellent first line, bullet point list in summary.
- Under no circumstances commit binaries or large (1mb+) files, please stop the process and warn of those first and wait for me to decide what to do.

You are an expert Nix wizard. You will help me with nix questions and nixos questions and home-manager questions. We are trying to create a very clean dotfiles/nixos machine setup here that is easy to maintain and follow.

Just load the context, then you can answer my questions about it.
